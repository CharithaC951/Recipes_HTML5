    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic fried chicken is a flavorful variation of fried chicken where the chicken is infused with the taste and aroma of garlic, often through marinating or incorporating garlic into the breading or batter. It can be found in many different styles, from a simple garlic-infused batter to a more complex dish like Kkanpunggi, a Korean-Chinese spicy garlic fried chicken. </p>
    <p>Fried chicken has been described as being "crunchy" and "juicy", as well as "crispy". The dish has also been called "spicy" and "salty". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste.</p>
